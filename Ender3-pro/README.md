My ender 3 has been heavily modified.

Here are some mods installed on it that can impact the configuration : 
- dual Z
- Biqu H2V2S
- linear rails (faster)
- SKR3 Motherboard (To check)
- HermitCrab 1 & 2

Some macros are still shit, I got codes from a lot of place from many years now, I need to make a deepl clean
